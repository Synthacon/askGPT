## Setting Up API Key and System Prompt

For the best experience, prepare these on your computer before configuring the plugin:

1. API Key Setup:
   - Create a text file on your computer
   - Save your OpenRouter API key in it
   - Transfer this file to your e-reader
   - Open the file and copy the API key
   - Paste it into the plugin's API key setting

2. System Prompt:
   - The Default system propt can be changed 
   - Create and edit your system prompt on your computer
   - Save it to a text file
   - Transfer to your e-reader
